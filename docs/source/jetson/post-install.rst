Adding a SSD Disk
-----------------

In order to add a SSD disk in Jetson board, we have to connect a SATA cable and a power cable in the board as illustrated in the image below:

.. image:: images/connect_ssd.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500pt

After connecting the SSD disk, we format it using ``ext4`` file system by logging into Ubuntu and accessing ``Disks`` application. Inside the application, select the SSD disk and click on the gear and select ``Format`` (or press ``Shift+Ctrl+F``). Then, add a name to the disk (e.g. ``JetsonSSD``) and click in ``Format``, as the images below:

.. image:: images/disks.png
   :align: center
   :width: 500pt

.. image:: images/format.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300pt

After formating the SSD disk, we have to mount it at startup. In order to do it, we have to add a call in ``/etc/fstab`` with the mounting point. In order to add this line, we have to discover the uuid of the device. With the disk manually mounted, we run the ``mount`` command to discover where the SSD is mounted, obtaining:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mount
    /dev/sda on /media/ubuntu/JetsonSSD type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisk2)

Knowing the mounting local of the SSD disk (``/dev/sda``), we have to discover its uuid. To discover the uuid we run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ls -al /dev/disk/by-uuid
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   9 Dec 31 21:00 ac183b24-3e75-4190-bcb7-32160e9a7c55 -> ../../sda

Having the uuid of the disk we can add a line to the ``/etc/fstab`` with a call to the mounting point. Running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo gedit /etc/fstab

We add the following line to the file:

.. code-block:: bash

    /dev/disk/by-uuid/ac183b24-3e75-4190-bcb7-32160e9a7c55 /media/JetsonSSD ext4 defaults 0 2

Save the file and close it. Next time Ubuntu is started, the SSD disk will be mounted at startup.


Important Packages
-------------------

Here we add several packages that should be installed to work in Jetson. All packages are installed via ``apt-get``. In order to easily install all packages a script was created and can be downloaded by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget --no-check-certificate --content-disposition https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsa-pucrs/platypus_doc/master/docs/source/jetson/scripts/additionalPackages.sh
    $ chmod +x additionalPackages.sh
    $ ./additionalPackages.sh

The script installs the following packages:

- `Informational list of build-essential packages (build-essential) <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/build-essential>`_
- `Cross-platform, open-source make system (CMake) <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/cmake>`_
- `Curses based user interface for CMake (cmake-curses-gui) <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/cmake-curses-gui>`_
- `GNU C++ compiler (G++) <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/g++>`_
- `Set of I2C tools for Linux <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/i2c-tools>`_
- `Userspace I2C programming library development files <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/libi2c-dev>`_
- `Distributed revision control system (Git) <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/git>`_
- `Multiple GNOME terminals in one window <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/terminator>`_
- `Terminal multiplexer with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation (Screen) <https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/screen>`_
