Jetson TK1 Board
=================

NVIDIA Tegra K1 (TK1) is NVIDIA's first mobile processor to have the same advanced features & architecture as a modern desktop GPU while still using the low power draw of a mobile chip. Therefore Tegra K1 allows embedded devices to use the exact same CUDA code that would also run on a desktop GPU (used by over 100,000 developers), with similar levels of GPU-accelerated performance as a desktop [1]_.
